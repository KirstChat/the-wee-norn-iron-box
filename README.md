## User Experience

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a subscription box service that will allow subscribers to choose from a range of drinks, foods and snacks that are only available in Northern Ireland. The project is aimed at anyone who lives/studies/works abroad or elsewhere in the UK, and misses the taste of home!

For Â£10 per month and free delivery, subscribers will receive a box each month containing their chosen Northern Irish goods. Subscribers can add the following to their box:

- 2 x drinks
- 2 x baked goods
- 2 x snacks

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

![Colour palette generated using coolors.co](wireframes/images/twnib-colour-palette.png)
_Colour palette generated using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co)_

The colour palette for this project is based on the colours of the Harland and Wolff cranes in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

- ![#161616](https://via.placeholder.com/15/161616/000000?text=+) `#161616`:
- ![#A30000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/a30000/000000?text=+) `#A30000`:
- ![#E00000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e00000/000000?text=+) `#E00000`:
- ![#FFB700](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffb700/000000?text=+) `#FFB700`:
- ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#FFFFFF`:

#### Typography

Throughout the site, I used two different fonts from Google Fonts. These were [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton#standard-styles) with the suggested pairing of [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

The Anton font was used for all main headings on the site and as the font for the logo text.

#### Imagery

The images used for this project are product images sourced from a variety of different websites. As this project is for educational purposes, I have credited the websites at the bottom of this document in the [credits](#credits) section. The product images used are of well known Northern Irish/Irish brands including [Tayto](https://www.tayto.com/) and [Maine Lemonade](https://www.mainesoftdrinks.co.uk/).

I designed a simple logo for the site using [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/). The logo is made up of an outline of the map of Northern Ireland and some text with the name of the site - "The Wee Norn Iron Box". I then downloaded a PSD box mock-up from [Free Pik](https://www.freepik.com/) and added the logo as well as some Northern Irish slang to the box to display on the landing page of the site.

#### Wireframes

The wireframes for my site were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

![Site Map](wireframes/images/site-map.png)

Links to the wireframes can be found below. Each link contains the wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices:

## Deployment

This project was developed on macOS using VS Code, with Git and GitHub used for version control. The project is hosted on Heroku, and all static and media files are stored on AWS Amazon S3.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository and make a local copy on your computer, follow these steps:

- Open GitHub and locate the GitHub repository: **Add Link Later**
- Under the repository name, click **"Code"** and copy the link to clone the repository using **"HTTPS"**
- After copying the link, open a terminal on your computer - this step can also be done in the terminal in your preferred IDE or Code Editor
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be saved
- Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL: **Add Link Later**
- Press Enter to create a local clone
- Create a **env.py** file to store environment variables: **Add These Later**
- Add the **env.py** file and the virtual environment folder (**"venv"**) to a **".gitignore"** file to ensure this information isn't pushed to the repository on GitHub
- Before installing any required dependencies, create a virtual environment - this will ensure that packages installed are only installed in the virtual environment folder: ```python3 -m venv venv```
- Run the following command to ensure you are installing packages in the virtual environment and not on your local drive: ```source ./venv/bin/activate```
- Install the required dependencies from the **"requirements.txt"** file to run the repository locally: ```pip3 install requirements.txt```
- Run the app from your local IDE or Code Editor by running the following command in the terminal: ```python3 manage.py runserver```

### GitHub

This project was coded in VS Code and pushed to GitHub using the following steps:

- Create a new folder in your preferred area in your local drive
- Open the folder in VS Code to start creating files
- Open source control in VS Code and select **"Publish to GitHub"**
- If prompted, sign into GitHub to connect your account to VS Code if you haven't done so already
- In source control, select **"Publish to GitHub"**
- Give your repository a name and select **"Publish to GitHub Public Repository"**
- After the repository is successfully published to GitHub, you can use git bash to add, commit and push any changes to the GitHub repository
- To stage a file to commit, use ```git add``` and the name of the file you want to commit or alternatively, use ```git add .``` to add all files to the staging area
- After adding a file to commit, use ```git commit -m "add commit message here"``` to specify what changes you have made to that file
- After committing a file, use ```git push``` to push all staged changes to the GitHub repository

### Heroku

The following steps were used to host the project on Heroku:

- Before creating a Heroku app, open the repository in VS Code and create a requirements file that lists all the applications and dependencies required to run the application: ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```
- Create a Heroku specific file called a Procfile - this is what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app and how to run it: ```**Add This Later**```
- Open [Heroku](www.heroku.com) and login to your account or sign up for an account if you don't already have one
- Open the dashboard and select **"New"** to create a new app
- Name the app and set the region to Europe
- Open the settings tab and open **"Reveal Config Vars"**
- Add the environment variables from the **env.py** file:
  - **Add These Later**
- To deploy the app from GitHub, open the deploy tab and change the deployment method to GitHub
- Connect to your GitHub account and search for the name of the repository to connect to
- Once connected, **"Enable Automatic Deployments"** and select the **"Master"** or **"Main"** branch to deploy
