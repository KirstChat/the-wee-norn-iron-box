## User Experience

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a snack box service that will allow registered users to choose from a range of drinks, foods and snacks that are only available in Northern Ireland. The project is aimed at anyone who lives/studies/works abroad or elsewhere in the UK, and misses the taste of home!

Registered users will receive a box containing 6 of their chosen Northern Irish goods all for the price of Â£10, including fast and free delivery.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The overall design of this project is simple and easy to follow, using block shapes with sharp edges and defined borders to display most of the content, mimicking that of a box.

![Colour palette generated using coolors.co](docs/images/twnib-colour-palette.png)
_Colour palette generated using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co)_

The colour palette for this project is based on the colours of the Harland and Wolff cranes in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

- ![#161616](https://via.placeholder.com/15/161616/000000?text=+) `#161616`:
  - Used as the background colour for the navbar and footer as well as the colour for text and buttons
- ![#A30000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/a30000/000000?text=+) `#A30000`:
  - Used as the hover colour for buttons
- ![#FF9F1C](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffb700/000000?text=+) `#FF9F1C`:
  - Used as the main background colour across all pages
- ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#FFFFFF`:
  - Used as the background colour for page headings and cards

#### Typography

Throughout the site, I used two different fonts from Google Fonts. These were [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton#standard-styles) with the suggested pairing of [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

The Anton font was used for all main headings on the site and as the font for the logo text, with Roboto being used for all other text.

#### Imagery

The images used for this project are product images sourced from a variety of different websites. As this project is for educational purposes, I have credited the websites at the bottom of this document in the [credits](#credits) section. The product images used are of well known Northern Irish/Irish brands including [Tayto](https://www.tayto.com/) and [Maine Lemonade](https://www.mainesoftdrinks.co.uk/).

I designed a simple logo for the site using [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/). The logo is made up of an outline of the map of Northern Ireland and some text with the name of the site - "The Wee Norn Iron Box". I then downloaded a PSD box mock-up from [Free Pik](https://www.freepik.com/) and added the logo to the box to use on the landing page. The outline of the map of Northern Ireland is also used for site favicon.

I also used [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) to create a simple **No Image Available** image that will display if there isn't an image available for a product.

#### Wireframes (**UPLOAD THESE!!!**)

The wireframes for my site were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

![Site Map](docs/images/site-map.png)

Links to the wireframes can be found below. Each link contains the wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices:

- [Home Page](https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box/blob/master/docs/wireframes/home.pdf)
- [Products Page](https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box/blob/master/docs/wireframes/products.pdf)
- [Add/Edit/Delete Products](https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box/blob/master/docs/wireframes/add-edit-delete-products.pdf) _(Superuser Only)_
- [Box Contents](https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box/blob/master/docs/wireframes/box.pdf)
- Checkout
- User Profile
- Add Review
- Login/Sign Up

There aren't any wireframes for the blog app as this was a suggested feature to add later in the development process. There also aren't any wireframes for the error pages as I decided to add these later in the development process.

### Features Left to be Implemented

In future releases of this project and as I continue to progress as a developer, I would like to add some additional features to improve the users overall experience:

- Subscription Payment Option:
  - I initially wanted to make this project a subscription box service but due to work commitments and time restraints, I opted for a single payment service to meet the project requirements
  - In future, I would like to try adding the stripe subscription payments again as this feature would allow users to have the option to receive a box every month rather than having to log on each time they wish to purchase one
  - Along with this, I would also like to give users the option to pause or stop their subscription at any time

- Multiple Payment Options:
  - This feature would give users various options to pay for their box or subscription using Apple Pay or Google Pay

- Additional Account Options:
  - I would like to give the user the option to create an account by logging in with one of their social accounts such as Facebook or Google
  - I would also like to give the user the option to delete their account if they no longer wish to use the service

## Deployment

This project was developed on macOS using VS Code, with Git and GitHub used for version control. The project is hosted on Heroku, and all static and media files are stored on AWS Amazon S3.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository and make a local copy on your computer, follow these steps:

- Open GitHub and locate the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box](https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box)
- Under the repository name, click **"Code"** and copy the link to clone the repository using **"HTTPS"**
- After copying the link, open a terminal on your computer - this step can also be done in the terminal in your preferred IDE or Code Editor
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be saved
- Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL: [https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box.git](https://github.com/KirstChat/the-wee-norn-iron-box.git)
- Press Enter to create a local clone
- Create a **env.py** file to store environment variables
- Add the **env.py** file and the virtual environment folder (**"venv"**) to a **".gitignore"** file to ensure this information isn't pushed to the repository on GitHub
- Before installing any required dependencies, create a virtual environment - this will ensure that packages installed are only installed in the virtual environment folder: ```python3 -m venv venv```
- Run the following command to ensure you are installing packages in the virtual environment and not on your local drive: ```source ./venv/bin/activate```
- Install the required dependencies from the **"requirements.txt"** file to run the repository locally: ```pip3 install requirements.txt```
- Run the app from your local IDE or Code Editor by running the following command in the terminal: ```python3 manage.py runserver```

### GitHub

This project was coded in VS Code and pushed to GitHub using the following steps:

- Create a new folder in your preferred area in your local drive
- Open the folder in VS Code to start creating files
- Open source control in VS Code and select **"Publish to GitHub"**
- If prompted, sign into GitHub to connect your account to VS Code if you haven't done so already
- In source control, select **"Publish to GitHub"**
- Give your repository a name and select **"Publish to GitHub Public Repository"**
- After the repository is successfully published to GitHub, you can use git bash to add, commit and push any changes to the GitHub repository
- To stage a file to commit, use ```git add``` and the name of the file you want to commit or alternatively, use ```git add .``` to add all files to the staging area
- After adding a file to commit, use ```git commit -m "add commit message here"``` to specify what changes you have made to that file
- After committing a file, use ```git push``` to push all staged changes to the GitHub repository

### Heroku

The following steps were used to host the project on Heroku:

- Before creating a Heroku app, open the repository in VS Code and create a requirements file that lists all the applications and dependencies required to run the application: ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```
- Create a Heroku specific file called a Procfile - this is what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app and how to run it: ```web: gunicorn the_wee_norn_iron_box:application```
- Open [Heroku](www.heroku.com) and login to your account or sign up for an account if you don't already have one
- Open the dashboard and select **"New"** to create a new app
- Name the app and set the region to Europe
- Open the resources tab and add ```heroku-postgresql``` to the add-ons
- Open the settings tab and open **"Reveal Config Vars"**
- Add the environment variables from the **env.py** file:

| KEY | VALUE |
| :---: | :---: |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY |
| DATABASE_URL | YOUR_DATABASE_URL |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | YOUR_EMAIL_HOST_PASS |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | YOUR_EMAIL_HOST_USER |
| SECRET_KEY | YOUR_SECRET_KEY |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY |
| STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET | YOUR_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET |
| USE_AWS | True |

- Temporarily add the DATABASE_URL to settings.py:

```bash
DATABASES = {
  'default': dj_database_url.parse('Postgres database URL')
}
```

- Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using ```python3 manage.py migrate```
- Load the data fixtures starting with categories and then products using ```python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>```
- You can create fixtures by using the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py dumpdata --app_name.model_name --indent 2 > fixtures_name.json
```

- Create a superuser for the Postgres database to access the admin panel using ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```
- Remove the Postgres database URL from settings.py as this cannot be deployed to GitHub for security reasons
- To deploy the app from GitHub, open the deploy tab and change the deployment method to GitHub
- Connect to your GitHub account and search for the name of the repository to connect to
- Once connected, **"Enable Automatic Deployments"** and select the **"Master"** or **"Main"** branch to deploy
- Click the **"Deploy Branch"** button to deploy the app to Heroku

### AWS Amazon S3 Bucket

The following steps were used to store static files and media files in an Amazon S3 Bucket:

- Login in to your [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account or create an account if you don't already have one
- Click on My Account and open the AWS Management Console
- Search for S3 in services and create a new bucket
- Give the bucket a name, set the region closest to you and uncheck **"Block all Public Access"**
- Open the new bucket and enable static website hosting located at the bottom of the page
- Open the permissions tab and edit the CORS configuration at the bottom of the page to set up the required access between the heroku app and the bucket:

```bash
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

- Open Bucket Policy on the permissions tab and open the policy generator
- Set the policy type to **"S3 Bucket Policy"**, the principal to **"*"**, the action to **"GetObject"** and add the ARN which can be found on the Bucket Policy Editor page
- Add the statement and then generate the policy
- Copy and paste the generated policy into the Bucket Policy Editor, adding a **"/*"** to the end of the resource key
