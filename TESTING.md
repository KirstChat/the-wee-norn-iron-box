## Known Bugs

Box App Toasts:

- Currently, subscribers box contents are limited to two products from each product category
- If a subscriber exceeds this limit for a category by trying to add a product from that specific category, both a success and an error toast will display
- The success toast will inform the subscriber that they've successfully added that item to their box even though that item isn't added to their box
- The error toast works as it should, informing the user that they've reached their limit for that specific category
