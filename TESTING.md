## Code Validation

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used to validate the HTML and CSS files in the project and check there were no syntax errors. The following shows the results for each page:

[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Products page displayed a bad value error for spaces in the subject line of mailto

- This was fixed by replacing all the spaces in the subject line with %20

After fixing the error on the products page, I ran all the pages through the validator again to check there were no other errors or warnings to show:

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

There were no errors displayed after running all css files through the validator but there were warnings for the use of colour variables which can be ignored:

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check that the JavaScript code in the project complies with coding rules and to check for any syntax errors:

## Other Issues

Stripe Subscription:

- The original idea for this project was to create a subscription service that would allow subscribers to receive their snack box each month
- While trying to implement a stripe subscription plan, I was unable to generate any successful payments
- Due to work commitments/project submission deadline impending, I opted for my back-up plan of a one time payment option, keeping the same price of Â£10 per box that contains 6 items chosen by the user
