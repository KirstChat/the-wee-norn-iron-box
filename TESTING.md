## Other Issues

Stripe Subscription:

- The original idea for this project was to create a subscription service that would allow subscribers to receive their snack box each month
- While trying to implement a stripe subscription plan, I was unable to generate any successful payments
- Due to work commitments/project submission deadline impending, I opted for my back-up plan of a one time payment option, keeping the same price of Â£10 per box that contains 6 items chosen by the user
